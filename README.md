# Multi-Label Classification of Infiltration and Effusion in Chest X-rays using Hybrid CNN-Transformer

This repository contains the source code implementation for the Final Project titled:
**"Multi-Label Classification of Infiltration and Effusion in Chest X-rays using Hybrid CNN-Transformer"**

## 📌 Method Summary
This study develops an **Ensemble** model combining two architectures:
1.  **DenseNet-121** (CNN) for local feature extraction.
2.  **Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16)** for global context understanding.
3.  **Ensemble Method**: Simple Averaging of the output probabilities from both models.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is a subset of **PadChest**.
Due to the large size of the dataset, image files are **not included** in this repository.
